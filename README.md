# Custom Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG) Test

This repository contains a custom-built **Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG)** implemented in Python. The project is part of the coursework for _Cryptography and Cyber Law_, demonstrating PRNG design, uniformity testing, and dependency analysis.

## 🔍 Objective

To design and evaluate a simple PRNG using a mathematical algorithm and analyze:
- Uniformity of generated numbers
- Statistical dependency between consecutive values

## 🧠 PRNG Algorithm Used

The generator uses a **Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)** algorithm with the formula:

X(n+1) = (a * Xn + c) mod m

Where:
- `a = 1664525` (multiplier)
- `c = 1013904223` (increment)
- `m = 2^32` (modulus)
- `X0 = seed` (initial value)

These are commonly used parameters that offer reasonable randomness for academic experiments.

- `README.md` — Project overview and documentation
- Any future plots or figures will be auto-generated by the notebook

## 📊 Analysis and Plots

The notebook performs:

### ✅ 1. **Uniformity Test**
A histogram shows that values are spread uniformly between [0, 1].

### ✅ 2. **Dependency Test**
A scatter plot of `X(n)` vs `X(n+1)` reveals the deterministic nature of the generator and possible patterns.

### ✅ 3. **Comparison with NumPy**
A visual comparison with Python’s `numpy.random` module highlights the differences in statistical quality.

✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how a simple algorithm like LCG can generate pseudorandom sequences, and how statistical tests can uncover the generator’s limitations. It's a great way to understand the strengths and weaknesses of non-cryptographic PRNGs.
